### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I've been building stuff and solving problems with code since 2011.  
Using PHP/Laravel and Javascript/Vue.js for work projects.  
F#, Elmish and more for side projects.  

Iâ€™m currently working on "Waze for mountain resorts" with user contributed data about conditions, wait times and more.

Iâ€™m currently learning Quasar for cross platform app development  

Ask me about functional programming with F# and MVU with Elmish
