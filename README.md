### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I've been building stuff and solving problems with code since 2011.  
Using PHP/Laravel and Javascript/React.js for work projects.  
F#, Elmish and more for side projects.  

### Current side project: 
[Wunti.app](https://wunti.app) which aims to be "Waze for mountain resorts" with user contributed data about conditions, lift lines and more.
Built with:
- Ionic + React + F#/Fable for the mobile app.
- Laravel for the backend
