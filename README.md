### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I've been building stuff and solving problems with code since 2011.  
Using PHP/Laravel and Javascript/Vue.js/React.js for work projects.  
F#, Elmish and more for side projects.  

My current side project: [Wunti.app](https://wunti.app) which aims to be "Waze for mountain resorts" with user contributed data about conditions, lift lines and more.

Ask me about functional programming with F# and MVU with Elmish
